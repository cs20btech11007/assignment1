\section*{1.12}A coin is biased so that the head is 3 times
as likely to occur as tail. If the coin is tossed
twice, find the probability distribution of
number of tails.\\

\subsection*{sol.}
 In the question given that,coin is biased and head is 3 times as likely to occur as tail.\\
the coin has tossed twice 
let i be random varaible i$\in\{0,1,2 \}$ denotes outcomes  in a experiment showing number of tails .\\
$P(i)_h$   denotes the out come is head.\\
$P(i)_t$    denotes the out come is tail .\\
Given that,$$P(i)_h=3P(i)_i$$
and we know that,
\begin{equation}
 P(i)_{h} +P(i)_{t}=1\\
\end{equation}\\

substitute in eqn (1)$$P(i)_h=3P(i)_i $$ 
$$P(i)_t+3P(i)_t=1$$
$$4P(i)_t=1$$
$$ P(i)_t=\frac{1}{4}$$
and $$P(i)_h=\frac{3}{4}$$\\
  using  binomial distribution and now finding  probability distribution of number of tails in the events.\\
$$ P(i=k)_t={n \choose k}( \frac{1}{4})^{n} (1-\frac{3}{4}) ^{n-k}$$
in the above event$ n=2$\\
$P(i=0)_t $ denotes the " 0 " number of times the coins showed tail in 2 tosses.\\
$$ P(i=0)_t={2 \choose 0}( \frac{1}{4})^{0} (1-\frac{3}{4}) ^{2-0}=\frac{3*3}{4*4}=\frac{9}{16}$$\\
\\$P(i=1)_t $ denotes the " 1 " number of times the coins showed tail in 2 tosses.\\
$$p(i=1)_t={2 \choose 1}(\frac{1}{4} )^{1} ((1-\frac{3}{4}) ^{2-1}=(2)*{\frac{1*3}{4*4}}=\frac{6}{16}$$\\
\\$P(i=2)_t $ denotes the " 2 " number of times the coins showed tail in 2 tosses.\\
$$p(i=2)_t={2 \choose 2}( \frac{1}{4})^{2} (1-\frac{3}{4}) ^{2-2}=\frac{1*1}{4*4}=\frac{1}{16}$$\\
